### Case Study 

When people apply for loan(s), the underwriter decides whom is a risky applicant or whom is a safe applicant. However, it is not always clear on the methology employed by an underwriter. In the present case study, I utilized Kaggle's Loan Defaulter data set to derive some insights into what an underwriter might be deciding on. The data set consisted of `307511 rows` `122 columns`.
